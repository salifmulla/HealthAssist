Many people struggle to understand medical information and often feel disconnected from healthcare professionals, especially those living in rural areas and those with limited access to healthcare. These people often lack the resources to fully understand medical information or get timely answers on health concerns. This can lead to confusion about treatment options, delayed decisions and make uneducated assumptions. There is a need for a simple tool that can answer basic health questions, explain complex medical reports, and provide guidance on symptoms and treatments.

HealthAssist is a smart AI tool that helps users get health advice and support. Powered by Googleâ€™s Gemini-Pro AI, it offers different features, like a chatbot to answer general health questions, a consultation mode for deeper health assessments, and a tool to summarize information from medical reports. HealthAssist can guide users on health questions, provide emergency advice when needed, and even allow users to download summaries of consultations or reports. This makes HealthAssist an easy-to-use, AI-driven helper for quick and accessible health support.
